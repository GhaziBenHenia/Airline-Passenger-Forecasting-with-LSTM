# Airline-Passenger-Forecasting-with-LSTM
This project leverages LSTM neural networks to forecast airline passenger traffic from historical data (1949-1960). It involves data preprocessing, LSTM model training, and evaluation, using Python libraries like Keras and Pandas. The goal is to accurately predict future passenger numbers.
